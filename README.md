# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone


## Introduction
The `Applied Data Science Capstone` is designed to demonstrate your ability to analyze, visualize, and model data meaningfully. By working on this project, you'll reinforce your understanding of critical data science concepts and showcase your skills to potential employers.

## Project Objectives
  - **Data Exploration**: Explore and clean the dataset initially.
  - **Data Visualization**: Create meaningful visualizations to identify trends and patterns.
  - **Model Building**: Develop predictive models using machine learning techniques.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of your models using appropriate metrics.
  - **Communication**: Present your findings and insights clearly and compellingly.

## Dataset
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones. 

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010.
SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website at 62 million dollars, whereas other providers charge upward of 165 million dollars each; much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage. 


Therefore, if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch. 

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This dataset records each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.
